# Matrix Rules:
- Matrix notation follows an **a<sub>y,x</sub>** / **a<sub>row,column</sub>**
  - This may add confusion in code due to the *x* and *y* being flipped making for-loops and array work frustrating.
  - How I have this set up is in arrays we use the normal **a<sub>x,y<sub>** whereas when we use functions such as *'get'* it follows the Matrix Math notation.
- When adding two Matrices, if they are of the same *width* and *height* you can add each index of the first Matrix to the same index of the second Matrix as shown below.
